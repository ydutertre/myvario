* 1.32
  - Fixed issue with vario tone frequencies and supported watches

* 1.31
  - Tweak tone curve to have continuous frequency values rather than discrete

* 1.3
  - Added a sink tone along with a sink tone threshold parameter

* 1.2
  - Added a proper tone, frequency, and vibration length curve (not user editable)

* 1.13
  - Fixed bug where vibrations wouldn't be triggered if tones were off

* 1.12
  - Changed activity name to My Vario

* 1.11
  - Added a smoothing parameter for the Kalman filter
  - Removed the GliderSK Lap feature for leaner application

* 1.1
  - Switched from a simple moving average filter to Kalman filter implementation
  - cleaned up all settings related to time constant and filtering

* 1.04
  - Removal of acceleration and rate of turn FIT fields and related filtering
  - Acceleration may be added back in the future, once Gyroscope data becomes
  available in Garmin SDK (for more reactive vario)

* 1.02 & 1.03
  - Amendment to Manifest & Changelog

* 1.01
  - Changed to larger fonts in Varioplot for better visibility while thermalling

* 1.0:
  Changes from GliderSK:
  - Removed Safety features and tones (App should NOT be used for safety)
  - Added vibration Vario for quiet flying
  - Added computation of wind direction speed
  - Changed general view to have wind direction and speed (acceleration and rate of turn removed)
  - Restricted views to General -> Vario -> Vario Plot/Thermal Assistant -> Log (removed other views)
  - Log view is skipped while the activity is recording (e.g. no need to check logs while in flight!)
  - Added auto-switch to Vario Plot when circling, and auto-switch back to previous view when no longer circling
  - Modified some default settings for free flight use-case
  - Added additional vario plot ranges (0.5m/px and 0.25m/px)
  - Added a Minimum Climb setting for vario
  - Removed AutoSpeedStop / Renamed setting to Auto Start (need to stop manually - this is to avoid issues where glider appears to have null ground speed, but still flying)
  - Removed destinations, destination storage, destination import (removes the need for Communications permission)
  - Direction unit added (in degrees, or as direction sector such as NW)
